My name is Yang Xu, currently in my first year of Master's degree in Computer Science at University of California, Santa Barbara. I graduated from Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU) in 2024 with a Bachelor's degree of Engineering in the major of Artifical Intelligence. I've got a one-year internship at Amazon Web Services (AWS) Shanghai AI Lablet, working as an Applied Scientist Intern. 

My research interest is much about generative AI, especially based on language models. I've got some experiences with large language model applications and pretraining. Meanwhile, I'm rather interested in the combination of AI and other disciplines, in particular AI x music and am currently working on it.

Personally, I'm a favor of Chinese Music, having an experiece of playing the Chinese 2-string fiddle (*erhu*) for over 15 years, and once served as the chief in the Chinese student orchestra of the China Welfare Institute Children's Palace. During my undergraduate years, I served as the conductor of the student Chinese music club there for one and a half years. Another interest of mine is *mahjong*, while I'm currently with an Ms2 ranking in the *riichi mahjong* game *MajSoul*.
